# Longest Increasing Subsequence
The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem is to find the length of the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. For example, the length of LIS for {10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80} is 6

More Examples:

    Input  : arr[] = {3, 10, 2, 1, 20}
    Output : Length of LIS = 3
    The longest increasing subsequence is 3, 10, 20

    Input  : arr[] = {3, 2}
    Output : Length of LIS = 1
    The longest increasing subsequences are {3} and {2}

    Input : arr[] = {50, 3, 10, 7, 40, 80}
    Output : Length of LIS = 4
    The longest increasing subsequence is {3, 7, 40, 80}
