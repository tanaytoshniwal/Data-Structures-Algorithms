# Inversion Count
Let A[0 ... n-1] be an array of n distinct positive integers. If i < j and A[i] > A[j] then the pair (i, j) is called an inversion of A (where i and j are indexes of A). Given an integer array A, your task is to find the number of inversions in A.

## Input Format
```
    Line 1 : n, array size
    Line 2 : Array elements (separated by space).
```

## Output Format
```
    Count of inversions
```

## Constraints
```
    1 <= n <= 10^5
    1 <= A[i] <= 10^9
```
## Sample Input
```
    5
    2 5 1 3 4
