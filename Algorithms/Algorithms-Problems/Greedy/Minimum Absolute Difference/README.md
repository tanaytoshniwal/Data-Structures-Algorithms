# Min Absolute Difference in Array

Given an integer array A of size N, find and return the minimum absolute difference between any two elements in the array.

We define the absolute difference between two elements ai, and aj (where i != j ) is |ai - aj|.

### Input format :
```
    Line 1 : Integer N, Array Size
    Line 2 : Array elements (separated by space)
```
### Output Format :
```
    Minimum difference
```
### Constraints :
```
    1 <= N <= 10^6
```
### Sample Input :
```
    5
    2 9 0 4 5
```
### Sample Output :
```
    1
```
